I'm no racist, I've never been a racist
I've never had anything against anybody
In this whole world and with God
As my witness, that's the truth

Last month I got a letter
From a Japanese exchange student
He said

I like you label and your music
But you really should stop talking
About the problems of a racist country
Called the United States of America

I've been in school in Minnesota
For the last few years and I've felt no hate
No hate for my differences
How about it?

So angry, angry I sat down
And wrote this song to tell you how I feel
My brothers shot for all of us
More grave than butchered cattle lining up

How brave to live with blinders on
You're living in a drunken college fairyland
